## Week 1 Write-Up
Week 1 was a great introduction into malware with lectures provided by the Director of threat intelligence at McAfee Labs whom of which discussed a wide variety of topics while including very relevant information. After viewing all lecture material I was thoroughly intrigued by the material provided covering malware which I would like to discuss in more detail. Some of the topics discussed pertained to malwares existence, Careers dealing with anti-malware, security terminology, Advanced Persistent Threats (APT's), and tactics/strategies.

### Malware's Existence
One of the main questions asked in the lecture was 'why does malware exist?'. During discussion a number of reasons were discussed such as political gain, financial gain, reconnaissance on an individual/group, denial of services, and destroying systems due to having the capability. From the discussion we can see like a number of harmful aspects to industries malware itself exists due to motives from other individuals. I always found motives as proof that no matter what industry you are in if there are tools to build/improve then they can be abused to destroy/harm others which for this class is software being utilized for malware.
